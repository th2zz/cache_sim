# Cache-Simulator

This is a simple cache simulator that calculates the number of memory writes and memory reads for a memory access pattern provided as a file.
The inputs to the program, aside from the file listing the memory accesses, are parameters that specify the cache to be simulated.

Note: Although the help function suggests n-associative caches are supported, there is not yet any provision for modelling n-associative caches. Only direct association is currently supported.
Moreover, the only replacement strategy currently implemented is the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) strategy, although the intention is to support Least-Recently-Used (LRU) replacement as well in the future.

Usage:
  <code>sim \<cache size\> \<associativity\> \<block size\> \<replacement algorithm\> \<write policy\> \<tracefile.txt\></code>

More information about arguments:

  <code>\<cache size\></code>:
    must be a power of 2 integer represented in decimal(base 10)
    
  <code>\<associativity\></code>:
    <pre>-direct  - simulates of a direct-mapped cache</pre>
    
    <pre>-assoc:n - simulates an n-way associative cache where n is an integer that is a power of 2</pre>
  
  <code>\<block size\></code>:
    must be a power of 2 integer represented in decimal(base 10)
    
  <code>\<replacement algorithm\></code>:
    <pre>-FIFO - simulates first-in-first-out replacement</pre>
    <pre>-LRU - simulates least-recently-used replacement</pre>
    
  <code>\<write policy\></code>:
    -wt - simulates a write-through cache
    
  <code>\<tracefile\></code>:
    Must be a text file with the memory access trace of a program.
    Each line in the file must be formatted as follows:
          'instruction pointer value'':'\<space\>'W or R signifying read or write'\<space\>'memory address accessed'
